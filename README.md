# ZombieSurvival
This was my introduction to Java, that I made my freshman year of college. I did this on my own with no outside assistance. The code is far from pretty, as it was designed before I had a proper understanding of OOP, however it works and that is what matters!

There is a seperate asset folder that contains all of the images that were used in the making of the game, however I have not uploaded this to gitHub. 

The Turret class is currently in development.

The Hostile class is currently in development.
